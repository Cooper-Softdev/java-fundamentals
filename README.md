### Lab 01 - Basics

1. Pluralize Function Addition: Updated Main.java with a new function called pluralize. This function takes in a word and a number. Depending on the number, the function will return the word in its plural form (with an 's') if the number is zero or greater than one.

2. Coin Flip Simulation: Incorporated a flipNHeads function which simulates the flipping of a coin. It continues to flip the coin until 'n' consecutive heads are flipped. Each coin flip result ('heads' or 'tails') is printed in the console, followed by a summary line stating "It took FLIPS flips to flip N heads in a row" once 'n' consecutive heads have been achieved.

3. Real-Time Clock Display: A clock function has been added to Main.java. This function continually outputs the current time to the console, updating every second.

### Lab 02 - Basic Library

1. Dice Roll Simulation: Incorporated a roll method in our program. This method accepts an integer 'n' and simulates the roll of a six-sided dice 'n' times. The method returns an array of the results from each dice roll.

2. Duplicate Detection Method: Included a containsDuplicates method to our suite of functions. This method checks an array for any duplicate values and returns a boolean - 'true' if duplicates are present and 'false' if no duplicates are found.

3. Average Calculation Method: Introduced an average method that accepts an array of integers. This method calculates and returns the average value of the numbers in the given array.

4. Lowest Average Detection Method: Implemented a lowestAverage method which takes in an array of arrays. This method processes each sub-array to determine its average, then returns the array with the smallest average value.
